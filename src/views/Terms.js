                      <p>
                        By using any Digital Work (<b>Item</b>) from Appmon (
                        <b>Creative Code SRL</b>), you agree that this End User
                        User License Agreement (EULA) is a legally binding and
                        valid contract and agree to be bound by it. You agree to
                        abide by the intellectual property laws and all of the
                        terms and conditions of this Agreement.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you do not agree to be bound by this agreement,
                        remove any <b>Item</b> from your computer now and, if
                        applicable, promptly return to Creative Code SRL by mail
                        any copies of the Item and related documentation and
                        packaging in your possession.
                      </p>
                      <h3>License Period</h3>
                      <p>
                        An <b>Item’s</b> License is for the life time. That
                        means, once you buy it, you can use the license forever
                        within the restrictions described in this document. Each
                        License includes between 6-months and 1-year of Premium
                        Support, upgrades and access to private repositories to
                        follow source code changes when needed. Please check
                        this term for each License and also read the Knowledge
                        Center for more details.
                      </p>
                      <h3>About the Source Code</h3>
                      <p>
                        Creative Code SRL sells the source code. So, you can
                        completely change it based on your requirements. Our
                        items use many libraries, which are free and open
                        source. If you need the source code of any library, you
                        can just get it from its repository. So, there is no
                        hidden code in that manner.
                      </p>

                        Your license to use any of our Items is limited to the

                        <li>
                          The Freelancer License grants you, the purchaser, an
                          ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use
                          of the digital work (*Item*) you have selected. Read
                          the rest of this license for the details that apply to
                          your use of the Item.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You are licensed to use the Item to create one single
                          End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single
                          application”), and the End Product can be distributed
                          for Free.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          An End Product is one of the following things, both
                          requiring an application of skill and effort.
                          <ol type="a">
                            <li>
                              For an Item that is a template, the End Product is
                              a customised implementation of the Item. For
                              example: the item is a website template and the
                              end product is the final website customised with
                              your content.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              For other types of Item, an End Product is a work
                              that incorporates the Item as well as other
                              things, so that it is larger in scope and
                              different in nature than the Item. For example:
                              the item is an UI Kit and the end product is a
                              website.
                            </li>

                        <li>
                          You can create one End Product for a client, and you
                          can transfer that single End Product to your client
                          for any fee. This license is then transferred to your
                          client.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You can make any number of copies of the single End
                          Product, as long as the End Product is distributed for
                          Free.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine
                          the Item with other works and make a derivative work
                          from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms
                          of this license. You can do these things as long as
                          the End Product you then create is one that’s
                          permitted under clause 3.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You can’t Sell the End Product, except to one client.
                          (If you or your client want to Sell the End Product,
                          you will need the Extended License.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool
                          or template, or with source files. You can’t do this
                          with an Item either on its own or bundled with other
                          items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t
                          re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with
                          superficial modifications. <br />

                          end user to customise a digital or physical product to
                          their specific needs, such as an “on demand”, “made to
                          order” or “build it yourself” application. You can use
                          the Item in this way only if you purchase a separate
                          license for each final product incorporating the Item
                          that is created using the application.

                          you will find the component identified in the Item’s
                          description page or in the Item’s downloaded files.
                          The other license will apply to that component instead

                          An End Product is one of the following things, both

                              For an Item that is a template, the End Product is
